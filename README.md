# Jukugo Relay

Jukugo is defined as an object of construction with two or more Kanjis.

In this game, we can use only a Niji-Jukugo which is constructed by two Kanjis.

## Rule:
1. First of all, you'll get one Jukugo from an opponent.
2. After you get Jukugo, you need to reply different Jukugo between the which and the previous have only one difference of Kanji.
3. The opponent will reply Jukugo between the which and the previous have only one difference of Kanji, and is completely different from the second previous Jukugo.
4. You must reply Jukugo between the which and the previous have only one difference of Kanji, and is completely different from the second previous Jukugo.
5. Repeat 3 and 4.
